  summary: |
    I have a big focus on doing things properly. 
    My highest priority is to write flexible and understandable code, which can be adjusted easily in the future. My code design is inspired by the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. As even the best code design cannot consider all future requirements, I believe in continuous refactoring to ensure the flexibility and comprehensibility of the code. My refactoring methodology is inspired by the book "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler.
